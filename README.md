Hi Earthlings, 

Will here, I am an aspiring data scientist with a background in physics and big data processing. As I develop my space station for travel through the depths of our universe and beyond, I shall  make it home in time for dinner, all the while reading gullivers travels and Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Make Peace...when available! If not available throw some quantum mechanics at the enemy, this makes for great conversation. 

## Leave the oven light on, I hate stubbing my toe!
